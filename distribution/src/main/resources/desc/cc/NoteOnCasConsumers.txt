Note: BioMedICUS does not use traditional Cas Consumers as they are functionally no different than Analysis Engines,
and in the current UIMA documentation it is recommended that all Cas Consumers be developed as Analysis Engines moving
forward.

Therefore, all BioMedICUS document writer AE descriptors can be found in the edu.umn.biomedicus.ae.writer package.
